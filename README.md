## Guide: Working on a FrontendMonitor Project, Creating a GitHub Repository, and Pushing with
GitHub Desktop

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to work on a FrontendMonitor project (HTML and CSS), create a
repository on GitHub, and push this repository using GitHub Desktop:

### 1. Working on the FrontendMonitor Project

1. **Open an HTML and CSS Editor**: Start by opening an HTML and CSS editor like Visual Studio Code,
Sublime Text, or Atom.

2. **Create a New Project Folder**: Within your editor, create a new folder for your FrontendMonitor
project. Name it appropriately, for example, &quot;my-frontendmonitor-project&quot;.

3. **Begin Working on the Project**: Start working on your FrontendMonitor project within this folder.
Write your HTML and CSS code, add files, images, etc.

4. **Regularly Save Your Work**: Ensure you save your work regularly within this folder to track your
progress and have backups.

### 2. Creating a GitHub Repository

1. **Visit GitHub Website**: Go to the GitHub website (https://github.com/) and log in to your account.

2. **Create a New Repository**: Once logged in, click on &quot;New&quot; to create a new repository.

3. **Name and Describe the Repository**: Give your repository a name, e.g., &quot;my-frontendmonitor-
project&quot;. Add a description to explain its purpose.

4. **Choose Visibility**: Decide if you want the repository to be public or private.

5. **Initialize with a README**: Check the box &quot;Initialize this repository with a README&quot; to create a
README.md file.

6. **Create the Repository**: Click on &quot;Create repository&quot; to finalize the creation of your GitHub
repository.

### 3. Pushing the Repository with GitHub Desktop

1. **Download and Install GitHub Desktop**: Download GitHub Desktop from the website
(https://desktop.github.com/) and install it on your computer.

2. **Open GitHub Desktop and Log In**: Launch GitHub Desktop, log in to your GitHub account.

3. **Add the Local Repository**: Click on &quot;File&quot; &gt; &quot;Add Local Repository&quot; and select the folder of your
FrontendMonitor project.

4. **Create the Local Repository**: GitHub Desktop will recognize the new local repository. Click on
&quot;Create &amp; Add Repository&quot;.

5. **Publish the Repository**: In GitHub Desktop, you will see your local repository. Click on &quot;Publish
repository&quot; to push it to GitHub.

6. **Commit and Push**: Add a title and description for your initial commit, then click on &quot;Publish
repository&quot;. Your repository will now be visible on your GitHub profile.

By following these steps, you can effectively work on a FrontendMonitor project, create a GitHub
repository, and push it using GitHub Desktop. Feel free to repeat these steps for future projects.
